# cgi code test



This is a standard maven build.   Takes in the URL as a parameter. 


Please note: 
1. Displaying nothing but the required output was a design choice.  I felt that following the exact requirements was important.
2. I always write JUnit tests.  Again I felt following the rules was more important and JUnit is a 3rd party lib.
